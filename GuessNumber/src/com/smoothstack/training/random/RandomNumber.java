//
//>User is asked a question to guess a number (may be between 1-100) 
//if the number he guesses is within 10 numbers plus or minus of the number the java program has, then exit out and give the answer
//if the number he guesses is not within 10 numbers, ask the user to keep trying and give him more chances.
//if he is not able to guess within 5 chances, exit and display 'Sorry’ with the number.
//Example: Random # generated is 63
//User’s guess must be between 53 to 73.
